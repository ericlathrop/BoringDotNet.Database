BoringDotNet.Database
==================
Type-safe, transaction-safe, dependency-injectable library for database access.

This library aims to remove most of the boilerplate for accessing a SQL database in .NET. Another goal is to keep everything type-safe, and prevent common mistakes like forgetting to open a transaction or forgetting to put connections in a using statement.

Adapters are provided for Microsoft SQL Server and MySql.
